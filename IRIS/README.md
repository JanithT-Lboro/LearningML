I first focused on a more surface level approach using inbuilt libraries from the Sklearn library as to create a model.  
See [iris.py](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/IRIS/iris.py)
I will then have a more in depth approach at attempting to do it from scratch as to better understand the function of the libraries themselves.
