I first focused on a more surface level approach using inbuilt libraries from the Sklearn library as to create a model.  
See [iris.py](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/IRIS/iris.py)  

# Visualisation of dataset
What the first 10 data points looks like:

Checking the general statistics of the dataset:

Checking that there is an even distribution of classes:

## Box Plot

## Histogram Plot

## Scatter Matrix

# Comparison of different methods
A comparison of the different accuracies achieved via the different methods of classification attempted:

# Evaluation
From the above results, it can be seen that any of the listed methods would perform well.  
I chose to use the SVM method going forward.  
I was able to achieve an accuracy of 93% with very good f1, prescision and recall results...
