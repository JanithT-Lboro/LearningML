This is a documentation of my progress in further solidifying my knowledge on Neural Networks following on from Andrew Ng's coursera course.  
## Neural Network with no Hidden Layer
See [Link]() for implementation of NN without hidden layers. As this was my first effort, I thought it best to start an implementation without a hidden layer. As this would only be able to use linear boundaries I created this very simple dataset:

From this dataset, it is obvious that there is a positive correlation between obesity and being diabetic.  
I trained it with a learning rate of 0.05 over 20000 iterations and was able to get a error of 0.0039.
I then tested this model on two test data points: [1 0 0] and [0 1 0].  
The model correctly gave [1 0 0] a confidence of 1.78%
and [0 1 0] a confidence of 99.53%

## Neural Network with One Hidden Layer
See [Link](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/NeuralNetwork/NN_withHiddenLayer.py) for my first implementation of a Neural Network with a single hidden layer from scratch.  
I created a non-linear dataset to test this on using 'make moons' from the Scikit library:  
![dataset](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/NeuralNetwork/images/Data.png)  
I was able to reach a loss of 0.06 using a learning rate of 0.01 over just 200 iterations.
