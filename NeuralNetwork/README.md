This is a documentation of my progress in further solidifying my knowledge on Neural Networks following on from Andrew Ng's coursera course.  

## Neural Network with One Hidden Layer
See [Link](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/NeuralNetwork/NN_withHiddenLayer.py) for my first implementation of a Neural Network with a single hidden layer from scratch.  
I created a non-linear dataset to test this on using 'make moons' from the Scikit library:  
![dataset](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/NeuralNetwork/images/Data.png)  
I was able to reach a loss of 0.06 using a learning rate of 0.01 over just 200 iterations. By adjusting learning rates and iterations this might be able to be reduced.
