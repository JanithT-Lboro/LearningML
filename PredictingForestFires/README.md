# About this dataset
Problem is to try to predict the burned area of forest firest in the northeast region of Portugal. 
Data was found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires)

## Attribute Information
For more information, read [Cortez and Morais, 2007]. 
1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9 
2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9 
3. month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec' 
4. day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun' 
5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20 
6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3 
7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10 
9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30 
10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100 
11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 
(this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make 
sense to model with the logarithm transform).

## Approach 
Due to the very skewed nature of the 'area' attribute, I made this into a logistic regression task in attempt to class whether or whether not a forest fire would occur.  
The workflow for this problem was as follows:
- load dataset
- visualise dataset
- perform some data preprocessing
- fit simple logistic regression model to training data
- predict for test inputs and compare results against test output    
- I also attempted to use feature importance to optimise the dataset, however found it to not be particularly impactful. 
This is easier recognised within the [source code.](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/PredictingForestFires/forestFires2.py)  
The various outputs from this workflow can be found below... 

## Variables Summary
The Rain variable was found to be incredibly skewed as can be seen and so was removed from the dataset.

### Feature Importances
![Feature Importances](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/PredictingForestFires/images/Feature%20Importances.png)
Due to the month data not classing very highly in feature importance, I removed them to see what effect it would have on the logistic regression model. It was found that it had very minimal impact. After further learning about other optimisation methods, I plan to return to this project to re-attampt its optimisation.
