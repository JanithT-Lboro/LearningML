# LearningML
A documentation of my route in learning ML  
  
Below is a list of the resources that I have used or referred to:  
- [How to Learn Machine Learning](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning)
- [Pattern Recognition by SERGIOS THEODORIDIS and KONSTANTINOS KOUTROUMBAS(https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/blob/master/PatternRecognition.pdf)

First, I fully completed Andrew Ng's very indepth course on coursera. 
Whilst old, it still seems to cover the fundamentals very well. The assignments I completed as part of this course can be found [linked](https://github.com/JanThan/LearningML/tree/master/AndrewNg_MLCourse).  

I have since begun working through the individual projects, listed [here](https://www.dezyre.com/article/top-10-machine-learning-projects-for-beginners/397), to further solidify what I have learnt from the course.
