Now that I understood the fundamentals, I thought it was needed for me to understand how to quickly build and deploy NN models.  
I was recommended the Keras python library, and applied it to the Cifar-10 dataset. 

# Summary of dataset
- 50k training examples
- 10k testing examples
- Images are 32x32 pixels
The dataset consists of 10 classes: [airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck]  
# Visualisation of dataset

# Evaluation of model
I was able to achieve an accuracy of ~80% over 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001.

I used a VGG-based architecture with some drop out regularisation, batch normalisation and weight decay.
